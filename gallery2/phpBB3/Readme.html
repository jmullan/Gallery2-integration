		Welcome to Gallery 2.1.  This integration package is part of the 
		ongoing effort to seamlessly integrate Gallery 2 in phpBB3.  
		Please read through this document carefully
		before integrating Gallery 2 and before asking for help.  We have
		taken care to try to answer as many of your questions here as
		possible.  If you don't read this and have problems, we may
		refer you back to this document as a first resource.
		</p>
		<p>
		<div class="important">
		<h3>NOTICE</h3>
		<p>
		<i>This integration is in beta stage and will likely change as phpBB3 
		evolves during it's path to final release.  The use of this package in a 
		live production environment is <b>not</b> recommended!</i>
		</p></div>
		<br />

		Description
		</a>
		</h2>
		<p>
		This package contains all the files and directories you will need 
		in order to integrate Gallery 2 into your phpBB3 website.  This integration package 
		is still under very heavy development and is being released as a beta package.  It's 
		limitations are many, bugs (probably) numerous.  But, we rely on you, the user, to locate 
		them and make us aware of them.	<b>Standard Disclaimer: Back up all files/folders/databases 
		related to Gallery 2 before attempting this integration.</b>

		<h3>NOTICE</h3>
		<p>
		This integration package <b>does not</b> install or configure Gallery 2 for you.  Before you 
		proceed with this integration, you <b>must</b> install and configure Gallery 2.
		</p></div>
		<br />
		<div class="important">
		<h3>IMPORTANT</h3>
		<p>
		The use of the Gallery 2 rewrite module in an integrated environment has proven to be a tricky task.  It is highly 
		recommended that you deactivate the Gallery 2 rewrite module prior to attempting this integration.
		</p></div>
		<p>
		There is a css issue with the integration that causes the Gallery fonts to be unreadably small.  
		The fix for this is in the mod files, but before you can apply the mod to the Gallery 2 css file, you need to 
		create a directory called "local" within gallery2/themes/matrix and copy the file gallery2/themes/matrix/theme.css 
		into the newly created "local" directory.
		</p>
		<div class="codecontainer"><h3>Unix Example</h3>
		<pre class="CodeSnippet Console">$ mkdir ~/public_html/gallery2/themes/matrix/local
$ cp ~/public_html/gallery2/themes/matrix/theme.css ~/public_html/gallery2/themes/matrix/local</pre></div>
		<div class="codecontainer"><h3>Windows Example</h3>
		<pre class="CodeSnippet Console">C:\> mkdir c:\web\gallery2\themes\matrix\local
C:\> copy  c:\web\gallery2\themes\matrix\theme.css c:\web\gallery2\themes\matrix\local</pre></div>
		<p>Next follow the instructions in one of the mod files.  You have a choice of using the plain text version 
		or the xml version.  It doesn't matter which one, they are both the same.</p>

		MOD instructions in new modx xml format
		</a></p>
		<p><a href="./integration_mods.txt">
		MOD instructions in plain mod txt format
		</a></p>
		<p>
		The gallery2 folder contains a customized breadcrumb navigation file that will include 
		a link back to your forum's index page.  To use this feature, create a directory called 
		"local" within gallery2/modules/core/templates/blocks and copy this version of BreadCrumb.tpl 
		into your new "local" directory:
		</p>
		<div class="codecontainer"><h3>Unix Example</h3>
		<pre class="CodeSnippet Console">$ mkdir ~/public_html/gallery2/modules/core/templates/blocks/local
$ cp BreadCrumb.tpl ~/public_html/gallery2/modules/core/templates/blocks/local/</pre></div>
		<div class="codecontainer"><h3>Windows Example</h3>
		<pre class="CodeSnippet Console">C:\> mkdir c:\web\gallery2\modules\core\templates\blocks\local
C:\> copy BreadCrumb.tpl c:\web\gallery2\modules\core\templates\blocks\local\</pre></div>
		<p>Note that you may want to alter the following line in the included BreadCrumb.tpl file to 
		reflect the actual home page of your forums:</p>
		<div class="instructions">
		<p><span class="code">&lt;a href="/" class="BreadCrumb-1"&gt;Forum Index&lt;/a&gt;</span></p></div>
		<p>After applying the mods, the font size will be normal in embedded mode, but oversized in the standalone Gallery.  
		After verifying the mods and the embedded Gallery are working, it is recommended that standalone Gallery be disabled 
		as there will no longer be a need to access Gallery in this way.  To disable standalone Gallery, open the file 
		/gallery2/config.php and find this line:</p>
		<div class="instructions">
		<p><span class="code">$gallery->setConfig('mode.embed.only', false);</span></p></div>
		<p>Then change to:</p>
		<div class="instructions">
		<p><span class="code">$gallery->setConfig('mode.embed.only', true);</span></p></div>

		<p>
		Before you can view your Gallery 2 installation in phpBB3, you must 
		first configure this integration package.  To do this, navigate to the 
		phpBB3 Administration Control Panel.  Then click on the System tab.  Under 
		Module Management, click Administration Control Panel.  In the list of modules, 
		click General, then Board Configuration.  In the Add module drop-down 
		list, select Gallery2 Settings, then click Add module.  At the Add module 
		confirmation screen, click Yes.  After the module is added, click Back to 
		previous page.  Finally, once back at the Module Management page, click Enable 
		at the Gallery2 Settings module. You have now successfully installed and 
		enabled the Gallery2 Settings module and can continue with the integration 
		settings.
		</p>
		<p>
		Now click the General tab and under Board Configuration, click Gallery2 Settings 
		and you should presented with the Gallery 2 Integration page containing four 
		choices under Administration Options.
		</p>
		<p>The first area is the primary integration settings.  If these are 
		incorrectly set, your integration will not succeed.  Fear not though, as you 
		should really only have to fill in one value, making it fairly painless.
		</p>
		<h3>Configure Settings</h3>
		<ol>
		<i>The following value depends on your particular installation and you must ensure it is 
		entered correctly.</i>
		<br />
		<li><b>URL path to the gallery2 directory</b> - This should be the only setting 
		that you really have to worry about. It is the URL you installed Gallery in and 
		the same as you'd use to view your gallery in standalone mode.  Proper examples 
		would be: <br />
		<div class="instructions">
		<p>http://example.com/gallery2/&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;OR&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
		/phpbb2/gallery2/&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;OR&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;/gallery2/</p>
		</div>
		</li>
		<br />
		<i>The next value will be auto-detected based on the file location the script is 
		running at and should be correct, however, you should double check it.</i>
		<br />
		<li><b>URL path to gallery2.php</b> - This is the URL that would take you 
		to your Gallery 2 installation when it is integrated.  For example:<br />
		<div class="instructions">
		<p>http://www.yoursite.com/phpbb2/gallery2.php&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;OR&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
		/phpbb2/gallery2.php</p>
		</div>
		</li>
		<br />
		<i>The next 2 values will be automatically generated and managed by the integration 
		package. Do not alter them. They will not contain any information until 
		after you've saved the config settings and run the user integration at 
		least once. This is normal.</i> (Try clicking Submit at this point and see if 
		the next value is filled in automatically.  If not, you will have to manually enter it.)
		<br />
		<li><b>Full file path to embed.php</b> - This setting is the 
		complete file path to the embed.php file in your Gallery 2 directory.  For example:<br />
		<div class="instructions">
		<p>/home/user/public_html/gallery2/embed.php</p>
		</div>
		</li>
		<li><b>Active Admin ID</b> - This setting is the gallery external id of a 
		valid admin and will remain blank until the user export is successfully run.<br />
		</li>
		</ol>
		<p>
		Click Submit to save the settings, then click Gallery2 Settings again to get 
		back to the four configuration options.
		</p>
		<h3>Link Settings</h3>
		<p>
		These settings control if and how Gallery 2 links are displayed in users posts and profiles.
		</p>
		<ol>
		<li><b>Gallery profile links</b> - Select Yes to enable a Gallery link button to 
		show in the users posts and profiles.  This is a button similar to the instant messnger, 
		pm, email, etc. buttons.  Select No to disable this feature.
		</li>
		<li><b>Gallery show all item links</b> - Select Yes to enable a list of thumbnails 
		with links to the original items in Gallery to be displayed in the users profiles.  
		Select No to disable this feature.
		</li>
		<li><b>Gallery show only album item links</b> - If Gallery show all item links is 
		enabled, this determines if a list of photos or only a list of albums is displayed.  
		If users have multiple albums, you may want to enable this.
		</li>
		<li><b>Gallery show all item links limit</b> - If Gallery show all item links is 
		enabled, this limits the number of items returned in the users profiles.
		</li>
		</ol>
		<p>
		Click Submit to save the settings, then click Gallery2 Settings again to get 
		back to the four configuration options.
		</p>
		<h3>Synchronize Users</h3>
		<p>
		This will export your phpBB3 users and create a Gallery 2 account for them 
		if they do not have one. You can select whether the export occurs immediately 
		or when the user first visits Gallery 2. For forums with more than one or two 
		thousand users, it is highly recommended to select Export User At Gallery 2 Access 
		or you will likely encounter a timeout before the export completes.  The phpBB3 
		admin accounts will also be	mapped to the Gallery 2 admin accounts.  Therefore, 
		if you're logged as an admin in phpBB3, you will also be logged as an admin in 
		Gallery 2.  During the export process you will see a progress bar showing the 
		export progress.  After the export completes, you will see a status page displaying 
		the results of the export.
		</p>
		<p>
		Click Gallery2 Settings to get back to the four configuration options.
		</p>
		<h3>Un-Synchronize Users</h3>
		<p>
		Only use this if you wish to remove all externally mapped users and their 
		items from Gallery 2.  Use this carefully, as it cannot be undone!
		</p>
		<p>In addition to these settings, you can control which users have admin permissions 
		in Gallery 2 from within phpBB3.  In the permissions areas of the Administrator 
		Control Panel under Admin Permissions, you will find an option in the Settings list 
		that says Can be administrator in Gallery 2.  You can set this to Yes or No for any user.</p>
