	* New: New popup window when exporting PHPNuke users

2005-08-10  Dariush Molavi  <dari@nukedgallery.net> 0.2.7
	* Change: Sidebar did not include G2 CSS. This fix takes care of that,
	  but invalidates the HTML that is generated, since the CSS
	  link tag is included within the body of the page.  Doesn't 
	  matter anyway, since PHPNuke's HTML is light years from valid 
	  to begin with.
