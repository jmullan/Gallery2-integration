Installation Instructions
-------------------------

1. Install Gallery 2 and Drupal (see their respective installation
   documents).  Gallery2 should be *inside* your Drupal installation
   so that it's accessible by the same website.  If you accidentally
   install Gallery somewhere else, you can create a symlink to it
   from inside your drupal site, eg:
     cd /var/www/drupal.site
     ln -s /path/to/gallery2

   Or you can move Gallery2.  If you're going to do that, read this
   FAQ:
     http://codex.gallery2.org/index.php/Gallery2:FAQ#How_can_I_move_my_gallery_installation_from_one_folder_to_another.3F

2. Copy the appropriate gallery.module file for your drupal version to your
   drupal modules/ directory and name it "gallery.module"

   gallery.module          -> Drupal 4.5, 4.6 using Gallery 2.0 (unsupported, deprecated)
   gallery.module.drupal45 -> Drupal 4.5, 4.6 using Gallery 2.1
   gallery.module.drupal47 -> Drupal 4.7      using Gallery 2.1

3. Enable the gallery module in administer -> modules in your drupal
   installation.

4. Go to administer -> settings -> gallery and enter the paths to your
   gallery2 installation.

   Standalone URL Location:
     This is where your standalone (not embedded) Gallery2 install is located.  Since
     Gallery2 uses the standalone location to serve some files, this is required.
     Trailing slash required.

     Examples:
       http://www.example.com/gallery2/
       /gallery2/

   Physical Location:
     Embedding requires portions of Gallery2 to be loaded by Drupal, so we need
     to know where those are found.  The full physical path is recommended, but a
     relative path may work.  (If relative doesn't work, use full)
     Trailing slash required.

   Example:
     /var/www/drupal.site/gallery2/
     gallery2/

  Your gallery should now be available at:

     http://your.site/gallery

5. (Optional) Enable the Gallery menu item
   From administer -> menus
   Locate 'gallery'
   Click 'enable'
   Fill in title and description and click save

6. (Optional) Enable the "Gallery Block" in administer -> blocks


7. (Optional) Enable Gallery Rewrite
   Install the Rewrite Module inside Gallery2 from the Site Admin -> Modules page
   Configure Rewrite from the Site Admin -> Rewrite page
   On the Setup tab of the Rewrite page

     Htaccess Path:  This should be set to the webroot for Drupal (ex: /var/www/drupal.site/)
     Public Path: This should be set to the URL root for Drupal (ex: / or /drupal/)

   Press Save

   Select the Rules tab and configure the rules for your purposes

   Then when you browse to http://your.site/gallery you should see short urls
   inside drupal.

NOTE: the default themes don't work so well with Drupal yet.  You'll get best
results if you edit the default theme and move all the blocks out of the sidebar
and into the album and photo pages.  There's a drupal specific theme on the way,
stay tuned.  Other embedding-specific themes such as WPG2
(http://wpg2.ozgreg.com/forums/viewforum.php?f=12) work well with
Drupal.
