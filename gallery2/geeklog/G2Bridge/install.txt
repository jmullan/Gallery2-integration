If you are upgrading from GL_Gallery2:

You must uninstall GL_Gallery2 which will remove your users from gallery.

To avoid this, use the included functions_upgrade_to_G2Bridge.inc file.

Just upload to your path_to_geeklog/plugins/GL_Gallery2 directory and rename it to functions.inc replacing the original.

Then run your uninstall.
