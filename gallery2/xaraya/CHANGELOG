Version 0.6.1 - 2005/03/21
----------------------------------
- Purge/Recall/Delete role in xaraya are now synchronized to G2 thanks to a
  bugfix in xaraya.
  Note: Delete role in xaraya will delete a G2 user directly. You cannot recall
        users in G2, so recall of the same user in xaraya, will create a new user
        in G2.
