Version 0.6.13 - 2006/02/05
----------------------------------
- Changes for Gallery 2.1 (GalleryEmbed::init and Core API 7,0 changes)
- The Login event handler works again. If you need to login users in G2
  when they login in xaraya e.g. because you show non-public G2 images
  in your xaraya articles, but don't use the image block for this purpose,
  then just uncomment the onUserLogin handler in xareventapi.php.

Version 0.6.12 - 2005/10/06
----------------------------------
CSS works now again. xaraya still doesn't offer what we need, but I'm "hacking" xaraya
by injecting CSS links in the <head> section by using the "add javascript" method.

Version 0.6.11 - 2005/09/19
----------------------------------
Including the G2 theme.css again, G2 URL rewrite doesn't work anymore 
(related to CSS issues) when embedded

Version 0.6.10 - 2005/07/15
----------------------------------
Sidebar inside / block switch works again (thanks to bharat)

2005/07/07
----------------------------------
Trying a hack to get the progress bars get to work
(e.g. site admin -> maintenance -> Build thumbs / resizes)
Before handling the request, xaraya's output buffers are stored and ended,
after the G2 request handling, the ob are restored (unless the G2 request
said it isDone, i.e. already outputted some data).

Version 0.6.9 - 2005/06/28
----------------------------------
Removed requirement to be in embedded mode during module configuration
Doing a xaraya version dependency check again
Improved the upgrade code

Version 0.6.8 - 2005/06/27
----------------------------------
Fix: Added xarGallery2Helper::xarServerGetBaseURI()

Version 0.6.7 - 2005/06/23
----------------------------------
Fix: Make loginRedirect an absolute URL. Before, the loginredirect pointed
to standalone G2.

Version 0.6.6 - 2005/06/23
----------------------------------
Fix: Disabled the short url support of the xaraya module as it obviously did not work 
     since we changed from path_info to mod_rewrite in G2. 
     You can still use short G2 urls (G2 module Url Rewrite) when embedded in xaraya!
     True xaraya short url support may be back in one of the next releases.

Version 0.6.5 - 2005/06/13
----------------------------------
- Changed the logout function to comply with the newest changes in G2

Version 0.6.4 - 2005/05/26
----------------------------------
- disabled pending user deletion in user synchronization code (doesn't work in 
  multisite G2 installs)
- tested G2 multisite+rewrite+embed+java-tools, it works all at once!

2005/05/21
----------------------------------
- Small internal change, (init/done calls)

Version 0.6.3 - 2005/05/13
----------------------------------
- Fixed a few bugs
- Postgres is now supported (xaraya 1.0 rc2, G2 0.9.16)

Version 0.6.2 - 2005/04/20
----------------------------------
- Reflect the GalleryEmbed::parseHead change for javascript
- Reverse the order of the css stylesheets (it was wrong before).
- Announcement: postgresql G2/xaraya will be supported in xaraya 0.9.14

Version 0.6.1 - 2005/03/21
----------------------------------
- Purge/Recall/Delete role in xaraya are now synchronized to G2 thanks to a
  bugfix in xaraya.
  Note: Delete role in xaraya will delete a G2 user directly. You cannot recall
        users in G2, so recall of the same user in xaraya, will create a new user
        in G2.
